            <h1>Summer Love and Chicken Katsu</h1>
            <h2>A Dish for the Toasty Days</h2>
            <div>
                Chicken katsu (チキンカツ) is made of chicken breast fillet breaded with flour, egg, and Japanese panko breadcrumbs, then deep-fried until golden brown. It’s the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork cutlet.
                <br>
                With just a few simple ingredients from your pantry, chicken katsu is something you can accomplish even on a weeknight meal!

            <div><strong>Dish Overview</strong><br>
                The thickest part of a chicken can be close to 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick and it is very hard to cook through.
                Therefore, we butterfly the chicken breast by splitting it horizontally, stopping before you cut all the way through
                it, and opening it like a book. When you open the breast, it hast two matching sides, resembling a butterfly.<br><br>
                For Japanese cooking, we butterfly it to the left and right sides to make it even, similar to a French door. We call this cutting technique Kannon Biraki (観音開き).
                <br><br>
                If you have younger children, you can also cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Interestingly, we do not cut the pork into small pieces,
                but many Japanese home cooks cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. To cut into smaller pieces, we use another cutting technique called Sogigiri (そぎ切り)
                instead of butterflying. You would hold the knife in an angle, nearly parallel to the cutting board, and then slice the chicken.
                This method will flatten the piece and give the chicken more surface area so that it cooks faster and evenly. <br><br>
                Lastly, remember that we eat chicken katsu with chopsticks. Make sure you cut into smaller pieces either before or after frying so you don't have to cut
                at the table.
