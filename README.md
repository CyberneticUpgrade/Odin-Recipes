# Odin-Recipes
Project for Recipe on Beef Wellingtion

Portfolio project to demo basic CSS and HTML knowledge and application
This will be and initial atomic commit with future atomic commits to modify and update repository

Plan structure:
HTML first to include sections for
-Overview (Prep-time, Level of difficulty, Servings yield, etc.)
-Ingredients (and subsections)
-Itemized Breakdown of meal (and subsections) [Example below:]
    *Duxelles
    *Beef
    *Green Peppercorn Sauce
    *Fingerling Potatoes
    *Wilted Winter Greens
-Directions (and subsections) [Example below:]
    *Duxelles
    *Beef
    *Green Peppercorn Sauce
    *Fingerling Potatoes
    *Wilted Winter Greens

Oftentimes, most recipe sites/landing pages tend to incorporate sleek, clean, bright-monochromatic (whitescale usually) UI/UX. I want to attempt the opposite end of that color spectrum with more of a "Dark Mode" approach in the design to give it a more minimalistic, yet tasteful site attraction. All the while bringing in appropriate imgs, animations, demos, and tools to make this achieveable.

From here this README will be update each time an atomic commit is made along with time-stamp to further record development of skill as well as site changes.
